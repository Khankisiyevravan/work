            I have created you a 28-day MBCT and Mindfulness Diary for you to
            print out or write online and use to help with reflecting on your
            mindful practices as well as your thoughts, emotions and behaviours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping a record of our mindful practices along with the thoughts,
            emotions and behaviours we exhibit allows us to reflect on them,
            understand them and improve on them if we need to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Follow through with this exercise for just 28 days and you may find
            that you want to keep doing it, you may find it helps you grow and
            become a better version of yourself each and every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enjoy the process of mindful meditation and keep practicing with me!
